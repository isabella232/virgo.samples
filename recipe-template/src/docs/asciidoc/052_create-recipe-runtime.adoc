=== Create the Custom Virgo Runtime

Create your own Virgo runtime with http://gradle.org/[Gradle] and https://github.com/eclipsesource/dockerizor[Dockerizor]:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
$ ./gradlew :{recipe-short-name}-runtime dockerize
----

The custom Virgo Runtime is packaged as `tar` archive and available from the runtime build directory.
Extract the runtime into some directory - let's say into `VIRGO_HOME`.

[CAUTION]
--
You'll need a https://www.docker.com/[Docker] daemon running in order to create your custom Virgo runtime.
For more information please refer to the https://github.com/eclipsesource/dockerizor/blob/master/README.md[Dockerizor documentation].
