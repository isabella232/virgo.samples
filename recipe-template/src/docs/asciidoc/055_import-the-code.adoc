=== Import the code into your Eclipse IDE

Now you can run +Import... Gradle -> Gradle Project+ to get the source into your IDE. The project folder is  called +{recipe-short-name}+ and lies directly in the "Sample Applications" folder you created previously with the Git clone command. (`org.eclipse.virgo.samples`).

NOTE: Before you can drag'n'drop the project onto your freshly created Virgo Server you might have to execute +Virgo -> Run Generation of META-INF/MANIFEST.MF File+ (via a right click on the project) within your Eclipse IDE.
