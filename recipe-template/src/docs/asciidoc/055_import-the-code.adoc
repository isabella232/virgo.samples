=== Import the code into your Eclipse IDE

Now you can menu:Import[Gradle > Gradle Project] into your IDE.
The project folder is  called {recipe-short-name} and lies directly in the "Sample Applications" folder you created previously with the Git clone command. (`org.eclipse.virgo.samples`).

[NOTE]

Before you can drag and drop the project onto your freshly created Virgo Server you might have to execute
menu:Virgo[Run Generation] of +META-INF/MANIFEST.MF+ (via a right click on the project) within your Eclipse IDE.
