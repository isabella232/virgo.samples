=== Create the Custom Virgo Runtime

Create your own Virgo runtime with http://gradle.org/[Gradle] and https://github.com/eclipsesource/dockerizor[Dockerizor]
and https://www.docker.com/[Docker]: +$ ./gradlew :{recipe-short-name}-runtime:dockerize+

NOTE: You'll need a Docker daemon running in order to create your custom Virgo runtime. For more information please refer to the https://github.com/eclipsesource/dockerizor/blob/master/README.md[Dockerizor documentation].

Extract the `tar` archive of the custom Virgo runtime available from the runtime build directory: +{recipe-short-name}-runtime/build+ into some directory - let's say into `VIRGO_HOME`.
